To run mongoDB tests enable rh-mongodb26 and python27 Software Collections:
       $ scl enable rh-mongodb26 python27 bash

This directory contains a test suite for the mongoDB daemon. To run the 
currently existing test cases, execute "./smoke.py all" in this directory.

For use in Red Hat distributions, you should run the script as user mongodb, 
who is created with nologin shell however, so the best bet is something like:
       $ su -
       # cd /usr/share/mongodb-test
       # scl enable rh-mongodb26 python27 bash
       # su -s /bin/bash mongodb -c "./smoke.py all"

This will use the installed mongodb executables, but will run a private copy 
of the server process (using data files within /usr/share/mongodb-test/var/), 
so you need not start the mongod service beforehand.

To clean up afterwards, remove the created "var/*" subdirectories, eg
       # su -s /bin/bash - mongodb -c "rm -rf /usr/share/mongodb-test/var/*"

If one or more tests fail on your system, please read the following manual 
section for instructions on how to report the problem:

http://www.mongodb.org/about/contributors/tutorial/submit-bug-reports/

MongoDB offers these test suites: mongosTest, jsCore, quota, jsPerf, disk, 
noPassthroughWithMongod, noPassthrough, parallel, repl, replSets, dur, auth, 
sharding, tool, aggregation, multiVersion, failPoint, ssl, sslSpecial, gle, 
slow1 and slow2. To run a specific testsuite execute "./smoke.py TESTSUITE".

If you want to run a specific test, use the --mode=files option to smoke.py 
and specify what JavaSctipt file from /usr/share/mongodb-test/jstests/ you 
want to run. It is also possible to specify more files. For example to run 
jstests/libs/*.js files execute "./smoke.py --mode=files jstests/libs/*.js"

If you want to use an already running mongoBD server for specific tests, use 
the '--dont-start-mongod' option to smoke.py. Please note that in this mode, 
the test suite expects you to run mongod with desired options. For example, 
here is the command to run the "jsCore" tests with an external server: 
"./smoke.py --dont-start-mongod jsCore --port 27017"

For more options run "./smoke.py --help".


In Red Hat distributions use this syntax:
       $ su -
       # cd /usr/share/mongodb-test
       # scl enable rh-mongodb26 python27 bash
       # su -s /bin/bash mongodb -c "./smoke.py OPTIONS"

Notes:

- ARM architecture is not fully supported - 
  https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-1811

- This subpackage does not contain dbtest (it is going to be 
  deprecated) and perftest (it is not working at all) binaries.
